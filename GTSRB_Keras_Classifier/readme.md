## Traffic Sign Prediction using Keras and transfer learning

I used Kaggle's GTSRB dataset to classify road traffic sign using a deep convoluted neural network. 

I create two different models one using convoluted network and one using `VGG19` transfer learning.

I achieved a test accuracy of `80.23 %` and `88.89 %` using custom cnn and vgg19 model respectively.

Finally, I created a GUI app to use these modes to classify any given road sign image.
